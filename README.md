# cpp-spreadsheet

## Dev Info
Hi, I'm currently a computer science student with a keen interest in software development. This project, `cpp-spreadsheet`, is a small personal project that I am working on to enhance my skills in C++ and multithreading. My goal is to create a functional and efficient spreadsheet application while learning more about concurrent programming and software design. As we bid adieu, here is the project.

## Overview
`cpp-spreadsheet` is a multithreaded spreadsheet application written in C++. It allows users to create, edit, and manage spreadsheets with support for concurrent operations.

## Aims
- Multithreaded processing for efficient performance
- Support for basic spreadsheet operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- User-friendly interface
- File I/O for saving and loading spreadsheets

## Installation
To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-spreadsheet.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd cpp-spreadsheet
    ```
3. Build the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command from the `build` directory:
```sh
./cpp-spreadsheet
